## Mediapipe simple hand gesture detection

**Description**
This project aims to develop a simple hand gesture detection, and just for self-learning purposes.
The project is developed with reference to Nicholas Renotte 's YouTube video. If you seek development details and a guide, please watch his YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doDUihpj6ro).
This project collects self-captured gesture data and can recognize 3 gestures: Hello, peace, and salute.
If you want to run the code, simply download the file, and run the Jupyter Notebook.
